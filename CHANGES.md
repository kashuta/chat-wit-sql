# Dynamic UI Adaptation Implementation for Dante AI Data Agent

## Overview

This implementation adds dynamic UI adaptation to the Dante AI Data Agent, making the UI components conditionally render based on the data types present in query results. Additionally, it adds real-time execution progress updates using WebSockets.

## Key Features Added

1. **WebSocket-based Event Streaming**:
   - Real-time updates during query execution
   - Progress tracking for each execution step
   - Live log streaming from backend to frontend

2. **Dynamic UI Components**:
   - Conditional rendering based on data types
   - Only showing relevant UI sections for each query result
   - Improved user experience by focusing on relevant data

3. **Enhanced Progress Indicators**:
   - Visual progress bars with percentage completion
   - Sub-step indicators showing current actions
   - Timing information for each execution step

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **WebSocket Server Implementation** (`backend/src/server.ts`):
   - Added WebSocket server using the 'ws' library
   - Implemented client subscription system by queryId
   - Created event emission system for execution updates

2. **Common Types** (`backend/src/common/types.ts`):
   - Defined event types for WebSocket communication
   - Added interfaces for execution events
   - Extended query request/response types with queryId

3. **Query Execution Flow** (`backend/src/server.ts`):
   - Modified query processing to include queryId parameter
   - Added event emission at key execution phases
   - Included queryId in API responses

### Frontend Changes

1. **Data Type Detection** (`frontend/src/utils/dataTypeDetector.ts`):
   - Created utility to analyze query results
   - Implemented detection for user, balance, transaction, and log data
   - Defined data type flag interface for UI adaptation

2. **WebSocket Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocketEvents.ts`):
   - Implemented custom hook for WebSocket communication
   - Added event subscription system with callback registration
   - Handled connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, errors)

3. **Query Execution Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useQueryExecution.ts`):
   - Integrated WebSocket events for execution updates
   - Added data type detection for results
   - Improved progress tracking for execution steps

4. **Dynamic Result View** (`frontend/src/components/DynamicResultView.tsx`):
   - Created component for conditional UI rendering
   - Implemented logic to show only relevant sections
   - Improved organization of result data

5. **Progress Indicator** (`frontend/src/components/execution/ProgressIndicator.tsx`):
   - Enhanced with progress bar visualization
   - Added support for substeps and detailed progress
   - Improved styling and animations

6. **App Component** (`frontend/src/App.tsx`):
   - Refactored to use dynamic components
   - Improved rendering logic for different application states
   - Enhanced filter integration for transactions

## Package Dependencies Added

- **Backend**:
  - `ws`: WebSocket server library
  - `@types/ws`: TypeScript definitions for WebSocket

- **Frontend**:
  - `uuid`: For generating unique query IDs
  - `@types/uuid`: TypeScript definitions for UUID

## Setup Instructions

1. Run the setup script to install dependencies:
   ```
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - Caching query results by queryId
   - Persisting results between page refreshes

2. **Advanced Visualization**:
   - Dynamic chart selection based on data types
   - Interactive data exploration tools

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Screen reader support for dynamic components
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements

4. **Offline Support**:
   - WebSocket reconnection logic
   - Offline query queue with background sync
